## Problem❗ 
We know people struggle with meeting deadlines and have a lot of different things to write in one app.
So as our uni project, we’ve decided to code up a web app where you could keep track of tasks you need to do and goals to meet. In short, a progress tracker!

## Tools 🔍 
We developed our project by using:
- React JS
- Tailwind CSS
- MongoDB
- Express
- ZenQuote API
- MUI Material

## Unique Features ✨
We have:
- A progress bar that gives a visual for your task completion

- A page with recommendations when you decide to take a break

- And most importantly, a light and dark mode button!
